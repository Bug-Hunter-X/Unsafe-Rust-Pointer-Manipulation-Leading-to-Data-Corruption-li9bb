This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when dealing with unsafe code and raw pointers.  The `bug.rs` file shows how directly manipulating a vector's memory using `as_mut_ptr()` can lead to unexpected behavior and data corruption if not handled very carefully. The solution, `bugSolution.rs`, demonstrates a safer approach that avoids the pitfalls of raw pointer manipulation.
